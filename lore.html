    Before the first star, there was Chaos. For eons, the lone deity drifted through the void without purpose, without company. Eventually, a great weight settled upon him—a crushing loneliness that hollowed his soul. In despair, Chaos sacrificed his own cosmic essence, imploding himself. From that cataclysm, the universe was born, along with two divine children: Azura, the Creator, and Ahriman, the Destroyer.
    </p>
    <p>
For millennia, the siblings clashed across the stars, creation and ruin locked in endless war.
  Weary of battle and unable to shape new life while bound in combat, Azura devised a final gamble: to fall in battle, shed his body, and transcend into pure spirit. When Ahriman’s devastation spell struck, Azura’s form dissolved, but his essence endured—freer, faster, stronger. He drifted until he found a luminous star system, and there, a perfect world for his seed: Mana. From its soil and seas, he birthed the <a href="wizards.html">Wizards</a>—beings of good karma that used their power to create and solve everyday life problems. Mana flourished into a utopia, the Mana Realm, where creation itself thrived. But Ahriman was not gone. His destruction consumed a thousand galaxies before he sensed his brother’s lingering presence. Pursuing it, he entered the same strange galaxy—one infused with the remnant power of Chaos. It tore his form apart, scattering him into raw energy. Yet, like Azura, he endured. Twisted but cunning, he seeded Mana with his own children of war: The <a href="necronites.html">Necronites</a>. They had the destructive power and nature of their creator. Physically stronger and more prone to martial arts than the Wizards.

  Decades later, Mana Realm explorers went beyond the Great Forest and saw something that wasn’t written in any exploration before : The Necro Kingdom. Trying to get a closer look, Necronites scouting the area saw them and ambushed the group. The Wizards were slaughtered—save for one dying Aeromancer, who burned the last of his life force to warn the Realm. Several hours later in that same day, counselors debated diplomacy, but before a decision was made, they stopped upon hearing dying screams coming from outside. Desperation and urgency struck the Council. The young and frail were hidden away; the able went to battle, but they were unprepared for the blitz. The Necronites descended upon Mana coming from all sides, killing as many Wizards they could. Years passed and from the Hidden Temple, the remaining survivors grieved by death and revenge, forged themselves into powerful wizards. Now, they want to avenge their fallen and exterminate the Sons of Ahriman.
